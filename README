NOTES

Added iPython

Updated to new stable revision of web2py

Added README.html to Desktop of user dev. Placed as an overlay preconfigured .eclipse directory as /home/dev/.eclipse

Added LXDM for automatic launch of GUI.

apt-get install lxdm is now part of the first boot script with eclipse (followed by another apt-get clean). LXDM installed during the patch precluded the installation of security updates, the opportunity to set the root password, and the installation of Eclipse. So it had to be moved to init hook with Eclipse.

On first boot, the system goes to cli. It's an opportunity to set password for the end user (dev):

passwd dev

On second boot, the GUI starts and asks for login credentials. Log in as dev and Eclipse autostarts.

End-user documentation is in html format, can be found on the desktop, and is title README.html.
