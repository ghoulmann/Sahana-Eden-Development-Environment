<h1>End-User Usage Notes<h1>
<h2>User Account</h2>

The developer's account is dev. The password is set by root with the following command:<p>

<pre>passwd dev</pre>

To enter the command, use LXterminal in the accessories menu.<p>

Once the dev password is set, log out as root and login as dev.<p>

<h2>Escalating Privileges</h2>

It's important to know that dev can escalate privileges to perform commands with root privileges: this is crucial for shutdown, rebooting, etc. For example, to shutdown, open LXterminal as user dev and enter the following:<p>

<pre>sudo halt</pre>

Similarly, reboot from LXterminal:<p>

<pre>sudo shutdown -r now</pre>

<h2>Configuring the Network (Static and Dynamic)</h2>

To configure the network with a static IP address or to lease a DHCP address:<p>

<pre>sudo confconsole</pre>

Select advanced, select the option to configure network: once configured successfully, use the interface to quit the confconsole.<p>
